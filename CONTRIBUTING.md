# Branches

You should fork the project or create branch for new features.
The main branches used by the core team are:

- master - where we store the stable release of the app (that can be deployed to our demo instances),
- develop - the most recent version of the app - kind of "nightly" build.

Please use "develop" for development purposes as the "master" can be merged just as the new release is coming out (about once a month)!

## Issue reporting guidelines:

Always define type of issue:
* Bug report
* Feature request

While writing issues, be as specific as possible
All requests regarding support with implementation or application setup should be sent to contributors@vuestorefront.io

If the issue is about some changes with particular theme prefix the issue with theme name (ex. "[default] change product tile background color" )

## Pull request checklist

Here’s how to submit a pull request. <b>Pull request that dont meet this requirements will not be merged.</b>

1. Fork the repository and clone it locally fro the 'develop' branch. Make sure its up to date with current `develop` branch
2. Create a branch for your edits. Use the following branch naming conventions:
 * bugfix/task-title
 * feature/task-name
3. Describe what you've changed. Include screenshots of the new feature or the before and after if your changes include differences in HTML/CSS. Drag and drop the images into the body of your pull request.
4. Reference any relevant issues or supporting documentation in your PR (ex. “Issue: 39. Issue title.”).
